# Pania Project Guidelines

## Design Implementation Rules

1. **Never make assumptions based on "common design patterns"** - Always confirm with the user before making any design decisions that aren't explicitly specified in the Figma designs.

2. **When Figma designs are too large or inaccessible** - Ask the user to provide a smaller portion of the Figma design or clarify the specific styling details needed.

3. **Always follow the Figma designs exactly** - Do not improvise or make "improvements" without explicit approval.
